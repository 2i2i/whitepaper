## mostinclusive:
Considering only supplies of positive value, since we can support arbitrarily small or large values, in any type currency, we are most inclusive.

[^fairest]: The fairest value is achieved in the most open market possible based on the assumption that adding an intelligence to a group of intelligences increases the accuracy of the joined valuation of anything.

[^fungeNFTs]: Even an NFT could in this manner be broken into smaller pieces. Having art with higher fungability increases the size of the demand, however it also seems to decrease the perceived value by many.

[^fullsubjchoiceisbetter]: todo

[^distance]: We can choose any 2-dim distance measure, e.g. the Euclidean metric.

[^practicalchrony]: For practical reasons, such as real time FX changes, it can make sense to define the categories with a precision $\epsilon>0$, and the relative distance $\delta=\ln{\frac{q}{\underline{M}}}$ as follows

    $$\text{chrony (CHR)} \Leftrightarrow B \text{ is objective}\land |\delta| \le \epsilon$$

    $$\text{highroller (HR)} \Leftrightarrow B \text{ is objective}\land \delta > \epsilon$$

    $$\text{lurker (LURK)} \Leftrightarrow B \text{ is objective}\land \delta < -\epsilon$$


[^whylurkers]: Lurkers complete the picture of the demand. They allow the seller to realise the optimal minimum price. Traditional markets leave sellers blind to this entire bottom part of the demand.

[^assuming]: These are not real 'assumptions'. These prerequisites that we are asking for are trivial and hence we are "assuming" them to be true already. Real 'assumptions' can be wrong.

[^energyandinfo]: Energy and information as defined by the Sciences, as two fundamental elements of nature.

[^minvalue]: Every seller has the right to define it's own minimum value for a trade

[^allmarkets]: This can be made a formal statement thanks to us defining **currency** as generally as possible.

[^alltradeissequential]: Having a finite supply requires ordering of demand. All selling of any supply is approximately sequential. Even selling digital copies of a product that seems unlimited, is in fact limited due to network bandwidth being limited and servers usually order demand on a "first-come, first-serve" basis. When supply is very large vs demand, then modeling a simultaneous trading sequentially, is not any loss at all, as the sequence can simply move very fast, giving the illution of simultaneouity.

[^chronyonlyworstcasefinite]: This is a service guarantee for those bidding the minimum (chrony). A highroller is basically participating in an auction for a sooner service, which is only sooner iff $\mathcal{I}_\text{CHR} < \mathcal{I}_\text{HR}$. An subjective bid might never be serviced, as it depends on the seller's subjective value function. A lurker is by definition never serviced.

[^auditabilityisbetter]: Even better than transparency is privacy with auditibility. This allows entities to maintain private information whilst satisfying society that everything is legal.

[^multidimoptimisation]: Based on my own experimentation on highly noisy and highly dimensional optimisation, I have found a multi-start Nelder-Maed to provide the best result. By observing resulting parameter distributions based on diverse starting points, by coincidence, an anomoly of noise presenting as a spike can be confused for a true optimum, which should have many starting points ending in it.

[^implementation]: about.2i2i.app is the v1 version with supply=time. A v2 version is being built.
