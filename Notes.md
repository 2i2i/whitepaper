# <b>V.  Notes</b>

## most inclusive
Considering only supplies of positive value, since we can support arbitrarily small or large values, in any type currency, we are most inclusive.

## fairest
The fairest value is achieved in the most open market possible based on the assumption that adding an intelligence to a group of intelligences increases the accuracy of the joined valuation of anything.

## fungable NFTs
Even an NFT could in this manner be broken into smaller pieces. Having art with higher fungability increases the size of the demand, however it also seems to decrease the perceived value by many.

## full subj choice is better
Since the seller is using it's own subjective value function, there can be no apriori internal ordering. And since there is no point in cancelling bids by the seller, as a bid can simply reappear (unless the bidder is blocked), there is no need for any internal ordering. If the next bid is $\text{SUBJ}$ then the seller can choose any or none of the $\text{SUBJ}$ bids.

## distance
We can choose any 2-dim distance measure, e.g. the Euclidean metric.

## practical chrony
For practical reasons, such as real time FX changes, it can make sense to define the categories with a precision $\epsilon>0$, and the relative distance $\delta=\ln{\frac{q}{\underline{M}}}$ as follows

$$\text{chrony (CHR)} \Leftrightarrow B \text{ is objective}\land |\delta| \le \epsilon$$

$$\text{highroller (HR)} \Leftrightarrow B \text{ is objective}\land \delta > \epsilon$$

$$\text{lurker (LURK)} \Leftrightarrow B \text{ is objective}\land \delta < -\epsilon$$

## why lurkers
Lurkers complete the picture of the demand. They allow the seller to realise the optimal minimum price. Traditional markets leave sellers blind to this entire bottom part of the demand.

## assuming
These are not real 'assumptions'. These prerequisites that we are asking for are trivial and hence we are "assuming" them to be true already. Real 'assumptions' can be wrong.

## energy and info
Energy and information as defined by the Sciences, as two fundamental elements of nature.

## min value
Every seller has the right to define it's own minimum value for a trade.

## all markets
This can be made a formal statement thanks to us defining **currency** as generally as possible.

## all trade is sequential
Serviced is used as meaning "traded". Also,
having a finite supply requires ordering of demand. All selling of any supply is approximately sequential. Even selling digital copies of a product that seems unlimited, is in fact limited due to network bandwidth being limited and servers usually order demand on a "first-come, first-serve" basis. When supply is very large vs demand, then modeling a simultaneous trading sequentially, is not any loss at all, as the sequence can simply move very fast, giving the illution of simultaneouity.

## chrony only worst case finite
This is a service guarantee for those bidding the minimum (chrony). A highroller is basically participating in an auction for a sooner service, which is only sooner iff $\mathcal{I}_\text{CHR} < \mathcal{I}_\text{HR}$. An subjective bid might never be serviced, as it depends on the seller's subjective value function. A lurker is by definition never serviced.

## auditability is better
Even better than transparency is privacy with auditibility. This allows entities to maintain private information whilst satisfying society that everything is legal.

## multidim optimisation
Based on my own intensive research on highly noisy and highly dimensional optimisation, I have found a multi-start Nelder-Maed to provide the best result. Solutions that have many simulations ending in them are much more likely to contain true information, rather than noise, i.e. being less outlier prone.

## implementation
about.2i2i.app is the v1 version with supply=time. A fullv2 version for any supply and fully web3 will be built.

## whitepaper
Humanity keeps its reliable knowledge in whitepapers. Besides having an certain look, the important aspects are structure and methodology. Such a paper adds to reliable knowledge if approved by scholars. An archived github seems more powerful than a pdf.
