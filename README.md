# media-stream model

audio, video, ar, vr
G->H
N->1
coins<->webstreams (webstreams=(webstreams,webstream))

# market model

v1 assumptions:
media stream is live

types:
HighRollers: bid > min
Chronies: bid == min
Eccentrics: bid [coin of subjective value]
Lurkers: bid < min

each type is an ordered list (by time).

zip-algo: combine diff type lists into a single ordered list
zip-algo is deterministic and depends on a simple H setting and handles setting changes

? Host has min requirement to exchange media-stream ~ req could be qualitative, e.g. have a certain ASA

? some ASAs are considered to have a low supply ~ let's call these NFTs
? these kind of bids req a min media stream duration ~ else G gets coin/s back

? H gives stream, G gives stream optionally

? if a good is non-exlusive => price is constant, i.e. no point in having a market
? no media-stream has infinite supply => there exists a theoretical max demand met => ordering required

? Host can change stream

? price is locked for a coin lock

? ??? add bandwidth control to price (higher price, more bandwidth) ~ via p2p network, rationing

? no bandwidth regulation of NFT bids

? streams/trades with max # Gs vs streams with no max # Gs
